# Goal Setting
- In the last sprint (Sprint 2), I decided to design the "scooper" for our bot. The purpose of the scooper is to pick up the objects that will be placed throughout the rescue line game course that we will need to rescue and store.
- However, in the last sprint, I ran out of time and was unable to fully complete my design (a simple robot arm) as I wasn't able to design the actual "claw" part of the arm.
- In this sprint, I will design a working claw for the arm that I made last sprint.
- I will know if I succeeded if my claw manages to clamp objects together tightly enough to pick them up.

# Research & Ideation
Reused Sources from Sprint 2 (Each reference bot has a different claw design that I can consider for my designs):
- Reference for how the Rescue Line game works and a bot reference (team Bitflip): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JicqYc9jaZM
  - Team Bitflip has a claw that consists of two semi-cylindrical clamps attached to servos that open and close to clamp the objects between the two semi-cylinders.

- Another bot reference (team Robolectro): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j1FszQWvsg
  - Team Robolectro has a claw that is made from two curved pieces that have a flat edge able to be placed flat on the floor. After it is placed on the floor, the two curved pieces attached to servos come together and close to clamp the objects. I think this design is cool because the pieces are curved in a way so that round objects fit really well within it, which is something I should consider for my designs.

- Bot reference number 3 (team Kavosh): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP99Jd03Dmo
  - Team Kavosh has a claw that follows essentially the same concept as team Robolectro.

New Research for Sprint 3:
- Bot reference number 4 (unknown team): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44IZUZ5mNx8
  - This bot's "scooper" has a unique design. Instead of a claw, it has a flat ramp-like base at the front that slides under objects. Then, when the objects are on top of that base, a servo retracts the entire thing to "dump" the objects in a storage unit. This could be a considerable design as it actually possesses the ability to pick up multiple objects at once.  

- Bot reference number 5 (team Bitflip again): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkcc-eY-xhg
  - Yet another team Bitflip line run. The interesting thing about this one is that their "scooper" is designed differently in this one. It's actually an interesting design. It's just a bell shaped container that envelopes the object when the arm goes down. Then, a tiny servo attachment pulls an elastic that tightens over the opening to secure the object inside. This is a simple design but it's actually pretty effective.
 
##### Research Conclusion
- I think there's some really great ideas that I can pull from each of these bots. I think the most important part however, for our bot specifically is space conservation. According to my partner who is currently designing the chassis, our space is pretty limited, so I will presumeably end up going for a claw approach over the giant retractable flat base. Also if our storage unit is constructed large enough to store two objects, the claw can just pick up multiple objects individually and place them in the storage, losing a bit of time but saving space.
