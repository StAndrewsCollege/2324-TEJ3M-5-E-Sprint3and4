# Goal Setting
- In the last sprint (Sprint 2), I decided to design the "scooper" for our bot. The purpose of the scooper is to pick up the objects that will be placed throughout the rescue line game course that we will need to rescue and store.
- However, in the last sprint, I ran out of time and was unable to fully complete my design (a simple robot arm) as I wasn't able to design the actual "claw" part of the arm.
- In this sprint, I will design a working claw for the arm that I made last sprint.
