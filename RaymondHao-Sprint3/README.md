# Goal Setting
- In the last sprint (Sprint 2), I decided to design the "scooper" for our bot. The purpose of the scooper is to pick up the objects that will be placed throughout the rescue line game course that we will need to rescue and store.
- However, in the last sprint, I ran out of time and was unable to fully complete my design (a simple robot arm) as I wasn't able to design the actual "claw" part of the arm.
- In this sprint, I will design a working claw for the arm that I made last sprint.
- I will know if I succeeded if my claw manages to clamp objects together tightly enough to pick them up

# Research & Ideation
Reused Sources from Sprint 2 (Each reference bot has a different claw design that I can consider for my designs):
- Reference for how the Rescue Line game works and a bot reference (team Bitflip): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JicqYc9jaZM
  - Team Bitflip has a claw that consists of two semi-cylindrical clamps attached to servos that open and close to clamp the objects between the two semi-cylinders.

- Another bot reference (team Robolectro): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j1FszQWvsg
  - Team Robolectro has a claw that is made from two curved pieces that have a flat edge able to be placed flat on the floor. After it is placed on the floor, the two curved pieces attached to servos come together and close to clamp the objects. I think this design is cool because the pieces are curved in a way so that round objects fit really well within it, which is something I should consider for my designs.

- Bot reference number 3 (team Kavosh): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP99Jd03Dmo
  - Team Kavosh has a claw that follows essentially the same concept as team Robolectro.
