# 2324-TEJ3M-5-E-1-Sprint3
Second sprint for RoboCup line rescue Competition

Teammates: Richard Zhao, Shuiyi Zhao, Hendry Shao

## Process

The steps outlined below are for my RoboCup robot progress for multiple weeks (February 29th - April 4th)

### Goal Setting

In the RoboCup competition, there is a section of the line following course called the "rescue" section. In this section, we need the robot to navigate a line-less rectangle and collect balls to put them in their correct boxes inside the rectangular section. We don't have a way to pick up balls in this section and need something to do so to gain more points in the competition. 

The current robot doesn't have anything to pick up a ball or store the balls but we do have a way to find the balls in the first place. One of my teammates in RoboCup is trying to get a camera working in the front of the robot to detect balls when they come in the camera's field of view. The robot will be able to navigate itself to the ball, but we don't have anything to pick it up. 

This sprint aims to find a way to pick up balls in this section of the competition.

### Research

#### Personal knowledge:
- Last year created a design for picking up balls
- Used a ramp-like system
- Pushed the ball against the wall
- Carried the ball in the curve
- Dropped the ball in the box backwards
- **Didn't work**

#### Other Group in RoboCup - Harrison Chen's group: 
- This group has made a claw/arm
- There is a claw at the end made of Lego pieces
- An arm is created from 3D printing
- Arm works from a Servo motor

#### Videos of RoboCup Competitors
- https://youtu.be/3Ero-oU5lw4
- In this team's design, they made a arm, claw, and a box in the back to hold the balls
- Using a camera or ultrasonic sensor, they were detecting balls
- Went close to the ball, then put the arm down and close the claw
- The arm goes back all the way and drops the ball in its box
- The robot locates the box and opens its box's gate to drop the ball in
